# Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation of Coordinated Emergency Response to Major Incidents

**Repository URL:** [https://github.com/Htamimi-421/Emergency-Response-ABMS](https://github.com/Htamimi-421/Emergency-Response-ABMS)

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete code for an Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) developed as part of a research study to investigate coordination mechanisms and informational dependencies during major incidents. The model simulates coordinated emergency responses involving ambulance, fire and rescue, and police services.

## 🚑 Research Context

This model has been developed to:
- Investigate the effects of different coordination mechanisms on emergency response effectiveness.
- Evaluate informational dependencies between ambulance, fire and rescue, and police services.
- Provide practical insights into improving coordination strategies and enhancing emergency response efficiency and effectiveness.
