Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation of Coordinated Emergency Response to Major Incidents
Repository URL: https://github.com/yourusername/Emergency-Response-ABMS

📌 Overview
This repository contains the complete code for an Agent-Based Modelling and Simulation (ABMS) developed as part of a research study to investigate coordination mechanisms and informational dependencies during major incidents. The model simulates coordinated emergency responses involving ambulance, fire and rescue, and police services.

🚑 Research Context
This model has been developed to:

Investigate the effects of different coordination mechanisms on emergency response effectiveness.

Evaluate informational dependencies between ambulance, fire and rescue, and police services.

Provide practical insights into improving coordination strategies and enhancing emergency response efficiency and effectiveness.
